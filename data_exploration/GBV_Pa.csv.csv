In accordance with the World Health Organization’s guidelines on the ethical collection of information on domestic violence, only one eligible woman per household was randomly selected for the module, and the module was not implemented if privacy could not be assured. In total, 6,379 women received the domestic violence questions. About 4% of women eligible for the domestic violence module could not be successfully interviewed because of privacy or other reasons. Specially constructed weights were used to adjust for the selection of only one woman per household and to ensure that the domestic violence subsample was nationally representative.",Demographic and Health Survey 2015-2016,"National Statistical Office (NSO) [Malawi] and ICF. 2017.

39,39,Swaziland,National Survey on Violence against Children in Swaziland,2007,Sexual violence,"Violence against children is a significant global health and human rights problem, and a growing concern in sub-Saharan Africa. The problem of violence against children spans geographical boundaries, culture, race, class, and religion. It can be expressed in the form of physical or sexual assault or abuse, psychological or emotional abuse, and deprivation or neglect. Violence against children is a profound violation of human rights and has devastating short- and long-term mental and physical health consequences.

This report focuses primarily on sexual violence against female children. According to the World Report on Violence and Health, sexual violence is defined as “any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work.”

The results of this study indicate that violence against female children is highly prevalent in Swaziland. Approximately 1 in 3 females experienced some form of sexual violence as a child; nearly 1 in 4 females experienced physical violence as a child; and approximately 3 in 10 females experienced emotional abuse as
a child.

Boyfriends and husbands were the most frequent perpetrators of sexual violence; male relatives (other than the victims’ father) were the most frequent perpetrators of physical violence; and female relatives were the most frequent perpetrators of emotional abuse. Incidents of sexual violence most frequently occurred in the home, either the home of the respondent or the home of a friend, relative or neighbor.

Over half of all incidents of child sexual violence were not reported to anyone, and less than 1 in 7 incidents resulted in a female seeking help from available services. Females indicated the primary reason for not reporting sexual violence was that they were not aware that what they had experienced was abuse. Many females also reported a fear of abandonment if they told anyone about the violence they had experienced. These numbers suggest a lack of understanding of what sexual violence is and how and where to report such incidents. In regard to physical violence, in only 1 out of 5 cases did females seek help from available services, despite the fact that nearly 1 in 4 resulted in injury that was serious enough to consult a doctor.


The objectives of this survey were to
(1) describe the epidemiologic patterns of sexual violence and other forms of violence;
(2) identify potential risk and protective factors for sexual violence;
(3) assess the knowledge and utilization of health services available for victims of sexual violence and other forms of violence;
(4) identify areas for further research;
(5) raise awareness about violence as an important health problem; and
(6) make recommendations on improving and enhancing interventions to better identify, treat and prevent sexual violence against children and its health related consequences.",National Survey on Violence against Children in Swaziland,UNICEF Swaziland,,English,Research and statistical data ,  Violence against children survey,"1,160,164",1.05%,"12,034",67,"17,200","-8,353",3.0,21,30%,0.01%,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of the NAP are as follows;
 
1. Reform, strengthen and implement relevant laws and policies for the prevention of GBV, ensuring accordance with international requirements and standards.
2. Ensure the Zambian population is aware that GBV is a wrongful behavior and a criminal act.
3. Build capacity of the relevant sectors (Health, Education, Social welfare, the judiciary and the justice system, NGOs) for mainstreaming GBV prevention and case management interventions in their policies, plans and programmes.
4. Offer comprehensive and ethical response to survivors/victims.
 
The NAP will focus its interventions around the following broad areas:
 
1. Ensure the review, adoption and implementation of protective laws and policies.
2. Advocacy/IEC/BCC and community mobilization and awareness raising for the prevention of GBV.
3. Build capacity or relevant sectors (health, legal/justice, security, education, and social welfare systems) for the development and implementation of comprehensive services for the management and care of survivors/victims of GBV in order to address immediate consequences as well as to reduce the likelihood of long-term negative effects related to victimization, as well as survivors‘/victims‘ vulnerabilities to future incidents of violence.",National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence ,Cabinet Office - Office of the President of Zambia,English,English,Policies ,  National action plan specific to violence against women,"18,383,955",2.93%,"522,925",25,"743,390","-8,000",4.7,18,45%,0.24%,Sub-Saharan Africa,Lower middle income,128.0,8.2016,167,28,16.8,-,-,-,-

(Module 18) EXCISION: Principaux résultats.

    La pratique de l’excision est quasi-générale au Mali puisque qu’elle concerne 91 % des femmes de 15-49 ans. C’est parmi les ethnies Sonraï (60 %),Tamachek/Bella et Bobo (64 %) que l’excision est la moins pratiquée (63 %).
    Parmi les filles de 0-14 ans, environ sept sur dix sont déjà excisées (69 %). Parmi celles de 10-14 ans, cette proportion est de 83 %.
    Les résultats n’ont pas mis en évidence une diminution de la pratique de l’excision.
    La majorité des femmes excisées ont subi la procédure avant l’âge de 5 ans, y compris dans la petite enfance (73 %).
    La grande majorité des femmes et des filles excisées (respectivement 91 % et 98 %) ont été excisées par des praticiens traditionnels, essentiellement des exciseuses traditionnelles (88 % parmi les femmes de 15-49 ans et 92 % parmi les filles de 0-14 ans).
    Une proportion élevée de femmes et d’hommes de 15-49 ans (respectivement 71 % et 66 %) pensent que l’excision est une pratique exigée par la religion.
    En majorité, les femmes et les hommes de 15-49 ans (respectivement 72 % et 79 %) pensent que l’excision devrait être maintenue.      


(Module 19) VIOLENCE DOMESTIQUE: Le module sur la violence domestique fournit des informations sur la prévalence de tout acte de violence commis par le mari/partenaire ou d’autres personnes sur les femmes depuis l’âge de 15 ans, y compris pendant la grossesse. Concernant la violence conjugale, c’est-à-dire celle exercée par le mari ou le partenaire (actuel ou le plus récent) contre des femmes actuellement en union ou l’ayant été, on a cherché à connaître le type de violence (émotionnelle, physique ou sexuelle) subie et sa fréquence. Les informations recueillies permettent de décrire différents aspects des violences faites aux femmes au Mali. Principaux résultats:
 

    Depuis l’âge de 15 ans, près de quatre femmes sur dix (38 %) ont subi des violences physiques, principalement exercées par leur mari/partenaire actuel ou le plus récent (65 %), mais aussi par la mère ou la femme du père (20 %), le père ou le mari de la mère (14 %) et/ou le frère ou la sœur(15 %).
    Plus d’une femme de 15-49 ans sur dix (13 %) a déclaré avoir été victimes d’actes de violences sexuelles à n’importe quel moment de leur vie.
    Parmi les femmes qui ont déjà été en union, 44 % ont subi des violences physiques, sexuelles ou émotionnelles de la part de leur mari actuel ou le plus récent.
    Un quart des femmes ont été physiquement blessées à la suite de violences conjugales dans les 12 derniers mois.                                                  

 
Les données collectées au cours de l’EDSM V permettent d’estimer la prévalence de l’excision parmi les femmes enquêtées, de connaître les types d’excision pratiqués, ainsi que l’âge des femmes au moment de l’excision et le type de personne qui a procédé à l’excision. On a également demandé aux femmes si, parmi leurs filles, certaines avaient déjà subi cette pratique pour déterminer dans quelle mesure elle se perpétuait d’une génération de femmes à l’autre. 
 
Pour connaître l’opinion des femmes au sujet de l’excision, on leur a également posé des questions sur leur opinion concernant la poursuite ou l’arrêt de cette pratique. En outre, une série de questions ont été posées aux hommes sur leur connaissance et leur opinion au sujet de l’excision.",,"Cellule de Planification et de Statistiques (CPS/SSDSPF), Institut National de la Statistique (INSTAT), Centre d’Études et d’Information Statistiques (INFO-STAT), Bamako, Mali.

The survey found that: 

    Women are most likely to be subjected to violence within the family and it revealed significant prevalence rates. 
    One in 10 women living with their husband or partner reported to be subjected “often” or “daily” to physical violence such as beatings, locking in or ejecting into the street during the last 12 months prior to the survey. 
    One in three women (31.4 per cent) reported to have been regularly subjected to threats of physical or emotional violence in the same period.
    10.9 per cent of women with a husband or cohabitant partner had been subject to forced sexual relations on more than one occasion.
    Women who are divorced, widowed or separated from their husbands are particularly likely to become victims of violence at the hands of both in laws and blood relations. Deprived of the husband’s support in the family structure, these women often find themselves in a particularly precarious situation.
    Women with less education or poor women were more likely to suffer violence and thereby underscored the fact that women’s educational and socio economic empowerment must form an integral part of any strategy to combat violence against women.
    7 per cent of all women have been sexually harassed in an educational or training institution and 1.9 per cent have even suffered sexual violence; 
    1.6 per cent of women reported sexual harassment at work and another 1 per cent was subjected to sexual violence.",,A/HRC/7/6/Add.2 p.15-16,English,French,Research and statistical data ,  Dedicated violence against women survey,"43,851,044",1.85%,"797,990",18,"2,381,740","-10,000",3.1,29,73%,0.56%,Middle East & North Africa,Lower middle income,73.0,5.2017,462,119,25.8,12.2018,132,9,6.8

Questions were addressed to women aged from 15 to 49 years whose husbands might strike them or beat them, for the purpose of evaluating their attitude regarding the various reasons for the violence. The results show that 51.5% of the woman approached thought that their spouses/partners could beat them for any reason mentioned in the questionnaire. This percentage is higher in the South province, where 63.4% of the women surveyed (as opposed to 47.0% in the North province and 51.9% in the Autonomous Sector of Bissau (SAB)) think that way. This attitude towards violence undergone by women is the same regardless of the area in which they live (51.1% in rural areas and 52.0% in urban areas). All this leads one to say that being the target of violent acts by their husbands or partners is not viewed as a scourge, but as an innate right founded on customary law.
On the other hand, the younger the woman is the less likely she is to accept this form of violence. More than half of women aged 20 years or more think that a husband has the right to strike his wife, whereas only 41.3% of women aged from 15 to 19 years find it normal for a husband to beat his wife under the same conditions. Marital status also affects women's attitudes. Married life tends to render women more receptive to male violence. Indeed, unmarried women are more likely to reject this idea: less than 40% of them think that husbands/partners have the right to beat their wives. This percentage becomes 45.2% for women who have been married or lived in a union and 57.2% for those currently married or living in a union. A similar effect can be observed with respect to the level of education: 41.0% of women who have reached the secondary level or higher find it acceptable that husbands should beat their wives as against 47.9% of for the primary-school level and 55.7% in the case of women who have received no education.

The VEARP is a training programme targeting the human resource cadres of both private and public sectors. Potential and existing victims as well as perpetrators of Gender Based Violence can be channelled to appropriate support services.

The Victim Empowerment and Abuser Rehabilitation Policy is a strategic and practical document. It aims at:
1) Making available VEARP services to stakeholders engaged in the fight against gender-based violence so that they may assist effectively both abusers and victims to end the vicious cycle of domestic violence.
2) It is also in line with the objectives of the Ministery of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare  to harness collective effort in eliminating gender-based violence.
3)It contributes, as well, to set guidelines for both the public and the private sectors in establishing workplace initiatives to fight gender-based violence.

A study commissioned by UNDP on “The Extent, Nature, and Costs of Domestic Violence to the Mauritian Economy” was conducted between 2008 and 2009 by the Mauritius Research Council. The study was released in 2010 and its key objectives were to determine the extent and nature of domestic violence in the country as well as to attempt to put a cost to this social problem. The study revealed that the burden of domestic violence in the Republic of Mauritius costed the economy some Rs. 1.4 billion (US $46,666,667) between 2008 and 2009. The Government subsequently developed the Victim Empowerment and Abuser Rehabilitation Policy, which aimed at empowering the human resource personnel of both the public and private sectors, through capacity building programmes, to detect cases of Gender Based Violence (GBV) and refer both victims and perpetrators to the Family Support Bureaux.",,"Government of Mauritius, National Review on Beijing +20, 2014 p. 29, 31

NOTE: the Protection from Domestic Violence Act (1997) was amended by the Protection from Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act (2004).

(e) confining or detaining the spouse against his will;
(f) harming a child or a spouse;
(g) causing or attempting to cause damage to the spouse's property

The Act affords protection to a ""spouse"" meaning either of a man and a woman who:
(a) are or have been civilly or religiously married to each other;
(b) are living or have lived together as husband and wife; and
(c) whether they have ever lived together or not, are the parent of a common child;
Therefore, the Act only applies to couples who are married either religiously or civilly.

- Protection orders, which have the effect of restraining the a spouse from engaging in any conduct which may constitute an act of domestic violence
- Occupation orders, which grant an exclusive right to the victim of domestic violence to live in the residence belonging to the aggrieved spouse, the respondent spouse or both of them
- Tenancy orders, which have the effect of vesting in the aggrieved spouse the tenancy of the residence.",,"Government of Mauritius, National Review on Beijing +20, 2014 p. 27

The FSBx (Family Support Bureaux) attend, assist and support women victims of domestic violence, network with NGOs, Community Groups and the Civil Society to conduct sensitisation and awareness campaigns in the community. Special programme like the “Building Partnership with Men and Boys for the Promotion of Gender Equality” and “Men as Partners” that are also spearheaded by the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare and implemented in collaboration with NGOs, Community Development Associations and other  grassroots organisations aim essentially to enlist the support of men and boys in promoting gender equality and utilise men’s friendly “Entertain to Educate” initiatives. An evaluation of these specific programmes reveals impressive gain in knowledge on Gender among grassroots men and women, increased understanding of couple relationship, and most importantly, a positive change in mind-set among the targeted population on gender stereotype issues.
The government through its Women Centres, Community Centres, Citizen Advice Bureaux, Social Welfare Centres, National Women’s Council and the National Women Entrepreneur Council undertakes on-going information and educational sessions and reaches people of all walks of life all around the country. Sensitization campaigns on radio, television and the written press are ongoing. The clips on the incidences of domestic violence that were released on television in 2011on the occasion of the Commemoration of the International Day Against Violence Against
Women proved very fruitful as reflected by the resulting increase in number of cases of domestic violence reported and addressed at the Family Welfare and Protection Unit of the Ministry of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare.",,"Government of Mauritius, National Review on Beijing +20, 2014 p. 28

329,329,Seychelles,National Survey on Domestic Violence,2006,Violence against women and girls,"The Gender Secretariat has conducted a nationwide survey on domestic violence, to investigate its extent, causes and consequences in the Seychelles context.  Preliminary findings suggest that domestic violence is a significant social problem that affects both men and women.  From a random sample of the population aged above 15 years old:


    42% of women and 36% of men admitted to having experienced emotional abuse by an intimate partner
    
    27% of women and 23% of men have experienced moderate physical violence
    
    28% of women and 26% of men admitted to being a victim of severe physical violence, and
    
    11% of women admitted to having been raped by an intimate partner


Although at the superficial level preliminary findings of the study indicated that an almost equal proportion of men and women reported having been victims of domestic violence, in-depth analysis has later confirmed established theory that the meaning and consequence of violence has a substantial qualitative difference to women than men.  For example: 33% of women suffered from aches and pains as a direct consequence of violence incidents compared to only 16% of men.

Moreover the findings also indicate that domestic violence directed at women by male perpetrators may have been functional as: 17% of women reported bruises to the face compared to only 6% of men.

This indicates that perpetrators specifically target the face causing visible injuries as a possible control mechanism, i.e. social isolation caused by embarrassment of exposing signs of violence. 

Alarmingly 8 women reported to having contracted HIV/AIDS and 21 women reported to becoming pregnant as a consequence of being raped by an intimate partner.
This is a significant number considering the size of the study sample and the small size of the national population.

La mise en place de la stratégie est venue couronner une large réflexion lancée en Tunisie depuis 2006. Elle s'est basée sur l'ensemble des résultats et recommandations issus des rapports, études et recherches réalisés par différentes institutions et organisations opérant en la matière ce qui a permis l'identification des formes de prise en charge des femmes victimes de violences.

La mise en place de la stratégie a suscité la mobilisation des différents secteurs concernés et particulièrement ceux qui sont directement liés à la prise en charge des femmes victime de violence ainsi que les prestataires de services (accueil, accompagnement, conseils juridiques, prise en charge médicale...), les membres qui ont pris part à la mise en place de la stratégie sont constitués de représentants de la société civile, des secteurs gouvernementales, des avocats et juges ainsi que des universitaires et experts en matière de genre.

Les articles 226 bis, 226 ter et 226 quater sont ajoutés au code pénal comme suit :

Artcile 226 bis: Est puni de six mois d'emprisonnement et d'une amende de mille dinars quiconque porte publiquement atteinte aux bonnes mœurs ou à la morale publique par le geste ou la parole ou gène intentionnellement autrui d'une façon qui porte atteinte à la pudeur.

Est passible des mêmes peines prévues au paragraphe précédent quiconque attire publiquement l'attention sur une occasion de commettre la débauche par des écrits, des enregistrements, des messages audio ou visuels, électroniques ou optiques.


Article 226 ter: Est puni d un an d'emprisonnement et d'une amende de trois mille dinars, celui qui commet le harcèlement sexuel.


Est considéré comme harcèlement sexuel toute persistance dans la gêne d'autrui par la répétition d'actes ou de paroles ou de gestes susceptibles de porter atteinte à sa dignité ou d'affecter sa pudeur, et ce, dans le but de l'amener à se soumettre à ses propres désirs sexuels ou aux désirs sexuels d'autrui, ou en exerçant sur lui des pressions de nature à affaiblir sa volonté de résister à ses désirs.

La peine est portée au double lorsque l'infraction est commise à l'encontre d'un enfant ou d'autres personnes particulièrement exposées du fait d'une carence mentale ou physique qui les empêche de résister à l'auteur du harcèlement.


Article 226 quarter: Les peines prévues aux deux articles précédents ne préjudicient pas à l'application des peines plus sévères prévues pour d'autres infractions.


Les poursuites ne peuvent être exercées qu'à la demande du ministère public sur la base d'une plainte de la victime.

Si une ordonnance de non-lieu ou un jugement d'acquittement sont rendus, la personne contre laquelle la plainte a été dirigée peut demander, s'il y a lieu, la réparation du dommage subi sans préjudice des poursuites pénales du chef de dénonciation calomnieuse.

The study revealed that the percentage of those ever subjected to physical abuse was 34% (40.5% females, 27.6% males) while those subjected to mental abuse was 59% (59.5% females, 58.5% males), and those who have experienced both physical and mental abuse was 69.3% (69.7% females, 68.9% males).

Availability and services delivered are publicly raised to the community through the national radio, national television, local newspapers, posters, and community meetings.   The victims who require medical support/assistance may be referred to the nearest Unit.  All gender-based violence victims are served in these centres.

Availability and services delivered are publicly raised to the community through the national radio, national television, local newspapers, posters, and community meetings.   The victims who require medical support/assistance may be referred to the nearest Unit.  All gender-based violence victims are served in these centres.

L'article 2 de la loi définit le trafic des êtres humains comme ""le processus par lequel toute personne est recrutée ou enlevée, transportée, transférée, hébergée ou accueillie à l'intérieur ou l'extérieur du territoire national par une ou plusieurs personnes physiques ou morales au moyen de menace ou d'autres formes de contraintes, de fraude, de tromperie, de détournement, d'abus d'autorité aux fins de son exploitation."" 

L'originalité de cette loi réside à plusieurs niveaux. Le gouvernement s'engage à mener une politique active de prévention de la traite des personnes notamment en établissant ou en soutenant des programmes de ""recherche, des campagnes d'information, de sensibilisation et d'éducation, des initiatives sociales et économiques et de formation, en particulier à l'intention des personnes vulnérables à la traite et des personnes concernées par la traite des êtres humains"" (article 16); à prendre les mesures législatives et autres mesures nécessaires pour assister les victimes dans leur rétablissement physique, psychologique et social; à promouvoir la coopération internationale pour lutter contre la traite des personnes.

Le projet, qui fait partie des cinq composantes du programme intitulé Les Femmes dans la paix et la réconciliation (PNUD), contribuera à sensibiliser la population sur la Violence dirigée contre les femmes (VCF) et au développement des méthodes (au plan médical, psychologique et sociale) pour apporter un appui pertinent aux et à assurer la prise en charge les victimes de la VCF en Côte d'Ivoire


Objectifs généraux : L'initiative du projet vise à renforcer la capacité nationale à lutter contre la VCF au plan national afin de permettre aux décideurs de prendre des décisions éclairées en matière de prévention de la VCF et de prise en charge des victimes. Le projet vise également à fournir une source de connaissances par la pratique en mettant en place des cliniques de santé pilotes consacrées exclusivement à la prise en charge des femmes qui ont été victimes de VCF.

Le résultat attendu à long terme est d'éradiquer la VCF et d'assurer une plus grande égalité entre les hommes et les femmes en Côte d'Ivoire. Les résultats à court terme sont la création d'une unité nationale hautement spécialisée pour le renforcement des capacités de lutte contre la VCF en faveur des groupes cibles spécifiques et la création de cliniques de santé pilotes dans le but d'élaborer, de raffiner et d'apporter un appui médical, psychologique et social aux et prendre en charge les victimes de VCF. 

Les stratégies qui seront appliquées pour atteindre les objectifs du projet comprennent la création d'une unité hautement spécialisée (centre des ressources), appuyée par l'expertise internationale, et la mise en place d'un lien interactif entre l'unité et les cliniques inclus dans le projet.",« Projet De Renforcement De La Capacité Nationale À Combattre Les Violences Basées Sur Le Genre Et Apporter Une Assistance Aux Victimes »,"Response of the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to the questionnaire on violence against women, 2009",,French,Coordinated and or Integrated service delivery ,"  One-stop centers, Prevention ,  Awareness-raising Campaigns, Monitoring and Evaluation ,  Services, Monitoring and Evaluation ,  Prevention","26,378,274",2.57%,"661,730",83,"318,000","-8,000",4.7,19,51%,0.34%,Sub-Saharan Africa,Lower middle income,160.0,12.2016,255,29,11.4,3.2018,99,19,19.2

Le projet, qui fait partie des cinq composantes du programme intitulé Les Femmes dans la paix et la réconciliation (PNUD), contribuera à sensibiliser la population sur la Violence dirigée contre les femmes (VCF) et au développement des méthodes (au plan médical, psychologique et sociale) pour apporter un appui pertinent aux et à assurer la prise en charge les victimes de la VCF en Côte d'Ivoire


Objectifs généraux : L'initiative du projet vise à renforcer la capacité nationale à lutter contre la VCF au plan national afin de permettre aux décideurs de prendre des décisions éclairées en matière de prévention de la VCF et de prise en charge des victimes. Le projet vise également à fournir une source de connaissances par la pratique en mettant en place des cliniques de santé pilotes consacrées exclusivement à la prise en charge des femmes qui ont été victimes de VCF.

Le résultat attendu à long terme est d'éradiquer la VCF et d'assurer une plus grande égalité entre les hommes et les femmes en Côte d'Ivoire. Les résultats à court terme sont la création d'une unité nationale hautement spécialisée pour le renforcement des capacités de lutte contre la VCF en faveur des groupes cibles spécifiques et la création de cliniques de santé pilotes dans le but d'élaborer, de raffiner et d'apporter un appui médical, psychologique et social aux et prendre en charge les victimes de VCF. 

Les stratégies qui seront appliquées pour atteindre les objectifs du projet comprennent la création d'une unité hautement spécialisée (centre des ressources), appuyée par l'expertise internationale, et la mise en place d'un lien interactif entre l'unité et les cliniques inclus dans le projet.",« Projet De Renforcement De La Capacité Nationale À Combattre Les Violences Basées Sur Le Genre Et Apporter Une Assistance Aux Victimes »,"Response of the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to the questionnaire on violence against women, 2009",French,French,Coordinated and or Integrated service delivery ,"  One-stop centers, Prevention ,  Awareness-raising Campaigns, Monitoring and Evaluation ,  Services, Monitoring and Evaluation ,  Prevention","26,378,274",2.57%,"661,730",83,"318,000","-8,000",4.7,19,51%,0.34%,Sub-Saharan Africa,Lower middle income,160.0,12.2016,255,29,11.4,3.2018,99,19,19.2
